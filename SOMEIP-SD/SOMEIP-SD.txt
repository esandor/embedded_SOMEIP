Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP - Service Discovery modul
    Official specification from AUTOSAR: https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPServiceDiscoveryProtocol.pdf

SOME/IP-SD overview:
    The main tasks of the Service Discovery Protocol are communicating the availability of functional entities
    called services in the in-vehicle communication as well as controlling the send behavior of event messages.
    This allows sending only event messages to receivers requiring them (Publish/Subscribe).

    SOME/IP-SD is used to:
        - Locate service instances
        - Detect if service instances are running
        - Implement the Publish/Subscribe handling

    Important:
        - SOME/IP-SD depends on SOME/IP.
          SOME/IP itself supports both TCP and UDP communications but SOME/IP SD is constraint to use SOME/IP only over UDP.

    There are no dependencides to AUTOSAR SW modules.

Note:
    The implementation is experimental and may deviate from the official specification.
    It is provided “as is,” without warranties.
    Validate against your target ECU/OEM profiles and perform comprehensive testing prior to use.
